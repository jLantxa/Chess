# Chess
A chess game and analysis tool built with Qt. It supports chess engines compatible with the UCI protocol, such as Stockfish.

**Currently implemented features:**
- Communication with Stockfish in multithread, multi PV mode.
- Loading a position for analysis using Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation.

# How to build
## Using Qt Creator
You can directly import the project into Qt Creator.

## Makefile
If you prefer not to use Qt Creator, you can use the ``Makefile``. Just make sure to point to your **qmake** binary using the ``QMAKE`` variable.

# Integration with chess engines
All communication with the chess engine occurrs via the ``QProcess`` class. ``QProcess`` provides a duplex communication channel with a child process using standard input/output. The UCI (Universal Chess Interface) establishes the commands and syntax to communicate with a chess engine. At the moment, this app only uses ``Stockfish``, as the process command is hardcoded. In the future it should be trivial to allow the user to specify path to any chess engine program, provided that this engine is compatible with the UCI protocol.
